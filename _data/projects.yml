      text: Rapid prototyping of interventional cardiac materials -- Invented a low-cost, additive manufacturing technique for shaping nitinol-based medical devices (e.g., heart stents), significantly reducing iteration cycles for device prototyping. This innovation streamlined design-testing loops from weeks to hours.
