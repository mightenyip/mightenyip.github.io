While working as a Research Fellow at the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard, I supported projects across many different low-cost, scalable microfluidic platforms including a paper-based gas sensor for sleep apnea, optimized thread-based ion sensors for agricultural and clinical diagnostics, and a microfluidic sampling device for precision agriculture.
