During my time at St. Jude Medical (now Abbott), I worked on manufacturing engineering and process development for medical device production. This role involved optimizing manufacturing processes, improving quality control systems, and ensuring efficient production of pacemakers and ICDs that meet regulatory standards.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

**Product Development & Quality Manufacturing:** Drove product development to achieve quality manufacturing experience for cardiac devices by implementing detailed design reviews, process development, verification, validation, and qualification of processes and parts, and the assembly itself.

**Cardiac Device Manufacturing:** Supported manufacturing projects of pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators including tooling design and process improvements, root cause identification, and adherence to quality system requirements for process validation.

**Project Management & FDA Compliance:** Managed projects from tooling for the Nanostim LCP to quick problem solving for floor production issues to FDA audit preparation.

**Root Cause Analysis & Process Improvement:** Supported Root Cause and Corrective Action (RCCA) using methodologies such as Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Key Characteristics, and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T).

**Process Optimization:** Streamlined manufacturing workflows and improved production efficiency through systematic process analysis and continuous improvement initiatives.

**Quality Assurance:** Implemented and enhanced quality control systems to ensure medical devices meet strict regulatory requirements and safety standards.

**Manufacturing Engineering:** Applied engineering principles to solve complex manufacturing challenges and improve product reliability.

**Cross-functional Collaboration:** Worked closely with R&D, quality, and production teams to ensure seamless transition from development to manufacturing.

## Quality Engineering Consulting

**Stasis Labs - FDA Strategy & Quality Experience:** Drove strategy for quality experience prior to PMA submission to the FDA. Developed quality control protocols and conducted extensive background research of monitoring systems in preparation for CE and Class II medical device FDA approval. Stasis Labs is transforming medical hardware into a data-focused, SaaS product by developing a cloud-connected vital signs monitoring platform. We were designing our solution in partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical System to target the 11M under-monitored hospitals beds across the globe.
