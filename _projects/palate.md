Food is medicine. However, food today is no longer grown but engineered to enhance palatability which has led to detrimental consequences. The excessive use of sugar in nearly every processed food has transformed our diets, resulting in unsatisfying meals that perpetuate hedonic cravings.

At Palate Therapeutics, we are committed to fostering a healthier society by redefining the way we experience the sweetness in our lives. Our goal is to provide people with a chance to reevaluate and consciously choose healthier food options. Rather than changing the composition of food, we aim to revolutionize how individuals taste and perceive sweetness, ultimately promoting healthier and sustainable eating habits. 

We were a preclinical stage company utilizing a unique mechanism of action targeting taste buds. In mouse models, we have demonstrated receptor modulation lasting up to 14 days with a single dose leading to minimal weight gain. Our therapy has the potential to be applied as a mono-therapy or in combination to existing GLP-1 based drugs. 

**My role as the Director of Science was to manage all the technical and scientific programs while supporting the operational day-to-day and business development. We raised a $645K pre-seed and have developed a strategic partnership with Novo Nordisk's BioInnovation Hub. Our first CPG product will be out in 2026 as a dietary supplement using naturally-occuring ingredients.**
