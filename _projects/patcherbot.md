I designed and commercialized the PatcherBot, an automated patch-clamp robot. Multiple custom builds, installs, and deployments at academic and pharma institutions around the world such as Biogen, Max Planck, Imperial College, etc. The startup had over 2 dozen deployments and over $1M in revenue. The PatcherBot was applied to multiple experimental pipelines for improved screening from pharmacology to optogenetics.


## Applications & Publications
