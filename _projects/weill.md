During my time at Weill Cornell Medicine, I contributed and led projects in AR-guided surgery, rapid prototyping of interventional cardiac materials, and validation of advanced biomaterials in cross-collaboration with clinical teams.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/img/projects/ar-hololens.png" alt="AR-Guided Surgery" caption="AR-Guided Surgery -- Co-developed an augmented-reality system for guiding interventional cardiologists during cardiac procedures, including stent placement. This involved system architecture prototyping, user feedback with physicians, and contributing to an invention disclosure." %}

## Key Projects

**Rapid prototyping of interventional cardiac materials:** [ASME Open Engineering](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/openengineering/article/doi/10.1115/1.4062282/1163196){: .btn .btn--primary}  
*Invented a low-cost, additive manufacturing technique for shaping nitinol-based medical devices (e.g., heart stents), significantly reducing iteration cycles for device prototyping. This innovation streamlined design-testing loops from weeks to hours.*

**Advanced biomaterials testing:** [RSC Journal of Materials Chemistry B](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/tb/c9tb00278b/unauth){: .btn .btn--primary}  
*Contributed to experimental development of novel materials, including optically cured hydrogels for injectable devices and slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces for friction-reducing applications in surgical tools and implants.*
